-Jg：Orthographic projection
============================

The orthographic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from
infinite distance. It is therefore often used to give the appearance of
a globe viewed from outer space. As with Lambert's equal-area and the
stereographic projection, only one hemisphere can be viewed at any time.
The projection is neither equal-area nor conformal, and much distortion
is introduced near the edge of the hemisphere. The directions from the
center of projection are true. The projection was known to the Egyptians
and Greeks more than 2,000 years ago. Because it is mainly used for
pictorial views at a small scale, only the spherical form is necessary.

To specify the orthographic projection the same options **-Jg** or
**-JG** as the perspective projection are used, but with fewer variables to supply:

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Optionally, the horizon, i.e., the number of degrees from the center
   to the edge (<= 90, default is 90).

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is distance on
   map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Jg**), or map width (**-JG**).

Our example of a perspective view centered on 75ºW/40ºN can therefore be
generated by the following ``pscoast`` command:

   ::

    gmt pscoast -Rg -JG-75/41/4.5i -Bg -Dc -A5000 -Gpink -Sthistle -P > GMT_orthographic.ps

-Jg：Perspective projection
===========================

The perspective projection imitates in 2 dimensions the 3-dimensional
view of the earth from space. The implementation in GMT is very
flexible, and thus requires many input variables. Those are listed and
explained below, with the values used in
Figure :ref:`Perspective projection <GMT_perspective>` between brackets.

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center (4ºE/52ºN).

-  Altitude of the viewer above sea level in kilometers (230 km). If
   this value is less than 10, it is assumed to be the distance of the
   viewer from the center of the earth in earth radii. If an "r" is
   appended, it is the distance from the center of the earth in
   kilometers.

-  Azimuth in degrees (90, due east). This is the direction in which you
   are looking, measured clockwise from north.

-  Tilt in degrees (60). This is the viewing angle relative to zenith.
   So a tilt of 0º is looking straight down, 60º is looking from 30º above
   the horizon.

-  Twist in degrees (180). This is the boresight rotation (clockwise) of
   the image. The twist of 180º in the example mimics the fact that the
   Space Shuttle flies upside down.

-  Width and height of the viewpoint in degrees (60). This number
   depends on whether you are looking with the naked eye (in which case
   you view is about 60º wide), or with binoculars, for example.

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is distance on
   map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Jg**), or map width (**-JG**) (5 inches).

The imagined view of northwest Europe from a Space Shuttle at 230 km
looking due east is thus accomplished by the following
``pscoast`` command:

   ::

    gmt pscoast -Rg -JG4/52/230/90/60/180/60/60/5i -Bx2g2 -By1g1 -Ia -Di -Glightbrown \
                -Wthinnest -P -Slightblue --MAP_ANNOT_MIN_SPACING=0.25i > GMT_perspective.ps
