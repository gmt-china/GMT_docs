-Jf：Gnomonic projection
=========================

The Gnomonic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from the
center onto a plane tangent to the surface. Its origin goes back to the
old Greeks who used it for star maps almost 2500 years ago. The
projection is neither equal-area nor conformal, and much distortion is
introduced near the edge of the hemisphere; in fact, less than a
hemisphere may be shown around a given center. The directions from the
center of projection are true. Great circles project onto straight
lines. Because it is mainly used for pictorial views at a small scale,
only the spherical form is necessary.

To specify the Gnomonic projection you must supply:

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Optionally, the horizon, i.e., the number of degrees from the center
   to the edge (< 90, default is 60).

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is distance on
   map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Jf**), or map width (**-JF**).

Using a horizon of 60, our example of this projection centered on
120ºW/35ºN can therefore be generated by the following ``pscoast`` command:

    gmt pscoast -Rg -JF-120/35/60/4.5i -B30g15 -Dc -A10000 -Gtan -Scyan -Wthinnest \
