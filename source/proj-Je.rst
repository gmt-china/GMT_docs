-Je：Azimuthal Equidistant projection
=====================================

The most noticeable feature of this azimuthal projection is the fact
that distances measured from the center are true. Therefore, a circle
about the projection center defines the locus of points that are equally
far away from the plot origin. Furthermore, directions from the center
are also true. The projection, in the polar aspect, is at least several
centuries old. It is a useful projection for a global view of locations
at various or identical distance from a given point (the map center).

To specify the azimuthal equidistant projection you must supply:

-  Longitude and latitude of the projection center.

-  Optionally, the horizon, i.e., the number of degrees from the center
   to the edge (<= 180, default is 180).

-  Scale as 1:xxxxx or as radius/latitude where radius is distance on
   map in inches from projection center to a particular
   oblique latitude (**-Je**), or map width (**-JE**).

Our example of a global view centered on 100ºW/40ºN can therefore be
generated by the following ``pscoast``
command. Note that the antipodal point is 180º away from the center, but
in this projection this point plots as the entire map perimeter:
